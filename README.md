# Bell Aliant Modem Bypass

How to Bypass your Bell Aliant provided Modems guides for a variety of Bell Aliant provided hardware.

## General Information on Bell Aliant's Infrastructure

Bell Aliant provides Atlantic Canadians with Passive Optical Networking in the form of GPON and now XGS-PON.

PON allows for multiple services to be provided by Internet Service Providers, such as Internet, VoIP and IPTV. Subscribers to Bell Aliant Services receive their services across either a coaxial or a Fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) setup. 

The line from Bell Aliant originates from their Optical Line Terminal (OLT), which terminates in an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) device or module.

The Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) used to segregate Internet, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) are:

| Service | VLAN |
|-|-|
| IPTV     | 34 |
| Internet | 35 |
| VoIP     | 36 |

Bell Aliant uses the Serial Numbers of your ONT device or module to authenticate your connection. There is no PPPoE User or Password used to authenticate your connection in Atlantic Canada.*

*Very old or some rural setups with Bell Aliant use ADSL and/or PPPoE.
